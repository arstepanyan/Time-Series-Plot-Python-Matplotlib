# Comparint High and Low Temperatures of 2015 with 2005-2014  

The data for this plot comes from Coursera's Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representaion in Python course offered by University of Michigan.
To avoid breaking the honor code of Coursera, I kept the code private.  

**Note**: On the plot, there are columns of dates. Although the columns seem to overwhelm the plot,
I kept them anyway as the main goal of making this plot is learning and the code for annotating the plot was worth keeping.
